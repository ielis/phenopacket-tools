# Phenopacket-tools

*Phenopacket-tools* is an open-source Java library and command-line interface (CLI) application for construction, conversion, 
and validation of phenopackets. 

The library simplifies construction of phenopackets by providing concise builders, 
programmatic shortcuts, and predefined building blocks (ontology classes) for commonly used elements 
such as anatomical organs, age of onset, biospecimen type, and clinical modifiers. 

The library validates the basic syntax and semantic requirements of the Phenopacket Schema as well 
as the adherence to additional user-defined requirements.
